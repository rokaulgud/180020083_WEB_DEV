          <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a junior undergraduate at IIT Bombay majoring in chemical engineering. My academic interests include engineering design and game theory.
            I play as a defender for the IITB hockey team (its mostly yelling frantically at midfielders to not let the ball reach you). I am currently
            a part of the IITB Racing team, a crew of 60+ students working together to build a formula student electric vehicle. I am a junior design engineer
            in the wheel assembly division, and currently exploring the possibility of implementing a hubless wheel system.<br/>
            In my spare time, I watch anime(call me a weeb, I'll take it as a compliment) and listen to J-Pop and classical music. I like telling people that
            I love to read.

          <h2 align="center" margin="10px">Technical Skills</h2>
          <p>This whole webpage is an instrument of self-promotion under the guise of a summer camp assignment :P. I am fairly comfortable with computer-aided
          modelling using SolidWorks and AutoCAD, and simulations using ANSYS Workbench. I can code in C++, python and MATLAB. I know just enough about
          arduino and circuits to tinker around and make mini projects <a href=" https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1vXhwmVeyB6 ">like this one</a>. I am
          learning web development, and as of now can host static webpages using HTML and CSS.

        <p>Just for the sake of including semantic tags, I have put up some boring information on this page, such as my education:</p>
